This repo has all the work done for Machine Learning for Public Policy, taught by Rayid Ghani (http://www.rayidghani.com/). Rayid is a Research Director at the Computation Institute, Senior Fellow at the Harris School of Public Policy, and Director of the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago.

### Course Description:

This course will be an introduction to machine learning and how it can be applied to public policy problems. Itâ€™s designed for students who are interested in learning how to use modern, scalable, computational data analysis methods and tools, and applying them to social and policy problems.

This course will teach students:

What role Machine Learning can play in designing, implementing, evaluating, and improving Public Policy
Machine Learning methods and tools.
How to solve policy problems using machine learning methods and tools
This is a hands-on course where students will be expected to use Python (as well as other computational tools) to implement solutions to various policy problems. We will cover supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and will learn how to use them with data from a variety of public policy problems in areas such as education, public health, sustainability, economic development, and public safety.
